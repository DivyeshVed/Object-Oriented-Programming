# Object-Oriented-Programming
This repo contains code that helped me learn Object Oriented Techniques in Java. 

This code was written while completing assignments towards the CS 1331 class at Georgia Tech.
The class introduced me to coding, and helped me understand the syntax and ideas of Object Oriented Progamming.

The following concepts were covered in this class:

    1.	HW1 --> Classes and objects, encapsulation, constructors, visibility modifiers, getters, setters.
    2.	HW2 -->  Inheritance, constructor chaining, copy constructor, static, wrapper classes.
    3.	HW3 -->  Abstract classes, overriding, equals, toString.
    4.	HW4 -->  Polymorphism, dynamic binding, casting, Interfaces, comparable
    5.	HW5 --> ArrayList using generics, Asymptotics, Searching, and Sorting. 
    6.	HW6 -->  File IO and Exceptions.
    7.	HW7 --> Recursion and Merge-sort.
    8.	HW8 --> JavaFX.
    9.	HW9 --> Generics, ADTs, Iterator, Iterable.
